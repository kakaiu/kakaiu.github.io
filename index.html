					<p>Hello, I’m Zhe Wang, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I graduated from Beijing Normal University with M.S. in Computer Science and Wuhan University with B.E. in Electrical Engineering. In addition, I have four years of R&D experience with VMware Internship during academic breaks.</p>
					<p>With my expanding technology stack, my constant curiosity has triggered different software systems meeting various urgent needs from the real world. I have implemented web-based, visual-based, interactive and distributed systems contributing to Open Innovation, Software Engineering, Cultural Heritage Preservation, Space Physics, Medical Imaging.</p>

					<h5>Open Compass</h5>
					<p>Open-source communities are vibrant and dynamic. There are millions of projects and contributors. It is hard to comprehend the whole picture of the landscape to understand the current structure, history and trend of various communities and interconnections among them. It will be hard for new participants to zero in new innovations and identify existing high quality projects. It will be greatly beneficial if there are some exploratory tools to survey and examine current landscape of the overall open source projects and communities.To address this challenge, we create the project Open Compass.</p>
					<p>Open Compass is the first online interactive map of the open source project repositories and their developers. The proximity among repositories and developers can be intuitively viewed as the visual distance. The closer the visual distance between the parties, the stronger connection among them. In this way, various open source domains can be transparently understood by observing their clusters and distributions, and insights can be heuristically achieved by explorations in the maps.</p>

					<h5>Autoguru</h5>
					<p>With the development of AI techniques, such as statistical machine learning, deep learning and visual analytics, great opportunities emerge in software engineering to reduce effort. Since data on which these techniques rely heavily is domain-specific, existing research and experience in AI techniques can not be referred directly. How to filling the gap between the state-of-the-art techniques and VMware software production is significant.</p>
					<p>Therefore, our starting point is building an automatic bug triage to accelerate the procedure of bug identification, aiming at identifying gaps between intermediate data of productions and prerequisites of the state-of-the-art techniques.</p>

					<h5>IVF - a highly interactive runtime for graph visualization</h5>
					<p>Interactive information visualization is becoming increasingly important. It can be used for large network system management like IoT system with billions of nodes. The requirement of seamless highly interactive user experience to explore the data is essential to such visualization systems.</p>
					<p>Many tools, like Gephi could visualize graphs but few simplifies the development to a complete interactive system. Although d3.js simplifies the development but it is not scalable. To address this issue, we design a GPU-based runtime with a proposed file format - IVF. By specifying the interaction in the portable IVF file, a complete system is established with little implementation difficulty and high-level scalability. The proposed runtime can stably run everywhere for seamlessly visualizing a large graph with billions of nodes.</p>

					<h5>ChinesePainting3D</h5>
					<p>With the increasing need for 3D Chinoiserie scene in educations and entertainments, introducing Chinese Painting to 3D Chinoiserie scene modeling is significant. In this project, we focus on modeling 3D terrain from Chinese Landscape Scene.</p>
					<p>ChinesePainting3D is the first system focusing on 3D landscape scene modeling from Chinese Painting. With techniques of interactive 3D modeling, 3D terrain is generated with three steps. Firstly, given a Chinese Landscape Painting, users sketch terrain, including mountain and ground out. And then the sketch is sampled and analyzed to generate a heightmap representing the skeleton of terrain surface. Finally, techniques of filtering and noise is utilized to optimize the surface for specific style in the painting.</p>
